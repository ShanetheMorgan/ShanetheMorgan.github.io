    <p>I have always had a love for reading, and have always very good at it </p>
    <p> In fact I was reading at an eigth grade level in third grade. I always prefferred fiction, as it told a complete story </p>
    <p> Due to my love of stories, I have decided to become some type of writer in future</p>

    <p>This is a peom I wrote in sixth grade during the pandemic, which was entered into a peom contest. While it didn't win the competition, it was deemed good enough to be published in a book containing a collection of peoms called <em>Expressions</em>.</p>

    <p>I unfortunately have not found enough time to continue this to much extent, however I do keep a journal of ideas for the future</p>
