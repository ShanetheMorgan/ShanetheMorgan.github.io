    <h1> Cross Country</h1>
    <p> I began cross country in the seventh grade at the behest of my mother
        This was due that I was always going ahead of everyone while we were going
        our hikes. I since continued to do <strong>to this day</strong>
    </p>


    <p> I am currently on the <strong>Redwood High School XC Team</strong>
    a team that has won several seasons, including getting second in boys MCALS and first in girls
    </p>
    <p>Our coach is the infamous Coach G, and while I won't mention any teammates, I can tell you 
        about some of the other staffe such as:

    <ul>
        <li> Coach G (previously mentioned) </li>
